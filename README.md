# Application of Linear Regression on SARS-CoV-2 concentrations measured in NYC Wastewater

### Dylan K. Picart

In this project, I seek to use linear regression to predict the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in NYC wastewater. I will be building out the API and using SQL to create a database with tables to store, manipulate, and discover insights about this dataset. Through the use of Pandas and Matplotlib, I will create visuals to gain insight into the trends of COVID over time.


For a comprehensive description of this dataset, please refer to the documentation source found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/SARS-CoV-2-concentrations-measured-in-NYC-Wastewat/f7dc-2q9f).
