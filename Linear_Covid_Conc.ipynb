Results of sampling to determine the SARS-CoV-2 N gene levels in NYC DEP Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) influent, disaggregated by the WRRF where the sample was collected, date sample was collected, and date sample was tested. This data contains sampling from multiple locations throughout NYC, and are appropriately labelled.\n",

In this project, I explore the commonalities between the infectious cases reported on media to the amount of gene levels prevalent in the wastewater. RT-qPCR was changed to digital PCR in April of 2023, resulting values are about 10-20 times higher than those of RT-qPCR. Please refer to the supporting documentation for more technical information.\n"

        "Our Visualization clearly shows that COVID concentrations rise during the winter months and fall during as we move away from the wintertime. As we see in our Linear Regression Model, we can see that COVID concentrations in the wastewater will continue to rise as winter draws near. Concurrently, we know that the covid rate exponentially increased over time, so we need to adjust our model to make an accurate prediction beyond a steady increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method of modeling can be applied to all 14 different locations where the genetic material for SARS-CoV-2 was measured in order to create predictions of Covid concentrations throughout NYC. However as these plots are inherently not linear, linear predictive models will of course not be the best method of modeling a prediction of covid data points, unless we apply an extraordinary amount of SCGD best fit lines similarly to how we would when taking partial derivatives. In this case, we could try a Multiple Linear Regression."
